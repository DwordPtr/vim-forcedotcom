vim-forcedotcom
---------------
This is a collection of vim scripts to setup syntax highlighting for force.com classes, pages, components and debug logs.

At the moment, it sets apex classes to use java syntax highlighting, and visualforce pages/components to use html syntax highlighting. Eventually, I will add custom syntax highlighting.

Installation
============
If you're using [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):
	$ git clone git://github.com/ejholmes/vim-forcedotcom.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-forcedotcom

Otherwise, copy all the files to their respective directories under ~/.vim
